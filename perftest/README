This is a project to time various languages in a simple task, that of
running "fmt", a simple text formatter that just fills lines to a
maximum length. Most versions were written by Learning Tree Course 396
author Mike Woinowski. Java and Python versions by Ian Darwin.

Data files: small: xboard README (BSD licensed)
	Medium - the GPL (only applies to itself here)
	Large - 5 copies of the source code (err, script)
		for "Two Gentlemen of Verona" by William Shakespeare
		(out of copyright!).

There is now a Makefile: just run "make" and you should get all the stats.
Makefile provided by original course author Ian Darwin.
